## 🔍 How It Works

### Example Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Too Few Blinks (Digital Eye Strain)
```
Your blink rate: 7 BPM
Normal range: 12-20 BPM

🚨 ALERT: "Severely Reduced Blink Rate"

Recommendations:
⚠️ Take an immediate break from the screen
💧 Use artificial tears or lubricating eye drops
👀 Practice conscious blinking exercises
🏥 Consider consulting an eye care professional

Medical Note: Studies show that blink rate can 
decrease by up to 60% during computer use, leading 
to dry eye syndrome (Tsubota & Nakamori, 1993).
```

#### Scenario 2: Too Many Blinks (Eye Irritation)
```
Your blink rate: 35 BPM
Normal range: 12-20 BPM

⚡ ALERT: "Excessive Blink Rate Detected"

Recommendations:
🛑 Take an immediate break from the screen
💧 Check if eyes feel dry or irritated
🌡️ Ensure proper lighting (avoid glare)
🧹 Check for environmental irritants

Medical Note: Excessive blinking can be caused 
by dry eyes, eye irritation, allergies, or eye 
strain (Bentivoglio et al., 1997).
```

#### Scenario 3: Extended Screen Time
```
Session duration: 125 minutes
Recommended max: 120 minutes

🛑 ALERT: "Extended Screen Time Alert"

Recommendations:
🚨 TAKE A BREAK NOW - You've exceeded recommended time
🚶 Stand up, walk around for 5-10 minutes
👀 Give your eyes a complete rest from screens
```

#### Scenario 4: Healthy Blink Rate
```
Your blink rate: 16 BPM
Normal range: 12-20 BPM

✅ "Healthy Blink Rate"

Great job maintaining healthy eye habits!
Keep up the good work!
