## Which Should You Use?

### Choose Python Version If:
- You want a traditional desktop app
- You need system tray integration
- You want it to run in background
- You prefer robust file-based storage
- You're comfortable with Python
- You need auto-start on boot

### Choose Web App Version If:
- You want instant access
- You can't install software
- You want to use on mobile
- You want to share with others
- You want to deploy online
- You prefer modern web apps

## Migration Between Versions

### Python → Web App
1. Export data from Python version
2. Manually import to web app (future feature)
3. Or start fresh with web app

### Web App → Python
1. Export JSON from web app
2. Import to Python version (future feature)
3. Or start fresh with Python

**Note:** Currently no automatic migration. Data formats are different.
